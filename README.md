# Task Automation System

## Overview

The **Task Automation System** is a comprehensive tool designed to automate and simplify a wide range of administrative tasks. This project provides system administrators with a powerful platform for managing users, logs, backups, hardware monitoring, network settings, and security. Built with Python, it integrates robust libraries to enhance functionality, scalability, and ease of use.

This tool is designed for administrators who need to streamline complex workflows, monitor system health, and maintain security compliance. By offering an intuitive interface and detailed reporting features, the Task Automation System ensures reliability and efficiency.

- Filter logs based on severity, date, or source for easier troubleshooting.
- Export logs in multiple formats for external analysis.

### Backup Management
- Create backups of critical files, user data, and system configurations.
- Automate backup schedules (daily, weekly, or custom).
- Restore backups with detailed error reporting in case of issues.

### Hardware Monitoring
- Monitor key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk space.
- Set custom thresholds for alerts on potential hardware failures.
- Generate detailed hardware health reports for long-term analysis.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Analyze system logs for potential vulnerabilities.
- Monitor security threats with real-time alerts.
- Generate reports for compliance with security standards like GDPR or HIPAA.

### Network Management
- View and manage active network connections.
- Monitor bandwidth usage and network bottlenecks.
- Configure firewall rules and detect unauthorized access attempts.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and configure the Task Automation System:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guilhermepachecod/task_automation
   cd task_automation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Access the system**:
   - Use the terminal for command-line operations.
   - If a web interface is configured, open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL.

## Configuration

The systemâ€™s behavior can be customized by editing the `config.json` file in the root directory.

### Sample `config.json`:
```json
{
    "backup": {
        "schedule": "daily",
        "storage": "local",
        "path": "/path/to/backups"
    },
    "logs": {
        "retention_days": 30,
        "alert_severity": "error"
    },
    "network": {
        "firewall": {
            "enabled": true,
            "open_ports": [80, 443]
        }
    }
}


Restart the application after making changes:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage Guide

### User Management
1. **Add a new user**:
   ```bash
   python main.py add_user --name "John Doe"
   ```

2. **List all users**:
   ```bash
   python main.py list_users
   ```

3. **Delete a user**:
   ```bash
   python main.py remove_user --name "John Doe"
   ```

### Log Management
1. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   python main.py view_logs --severity "error"
   ```

2. **Export logs to a file**:
   ```bash
   python main.py export_logs --format "csv" --output "logs.csv"
   ```

### Backup Management
1. **Create a manual backup**:
   ```bash
   python main.py create_backup
   ```

2. **Restore from backup**:
   ```bash
   python main.py restore_backup --file "backup_2023_10_15.zip"
   ```

3. **View backup status**:
   ```bash
   python main.py backup_status
   ```

### Hardware Monitoring
1. **Check current hardware stats**:
   ```bash
   python main.py monitor_hardware
   ```

2. **Set custom thresholds**:
   ```bash
   python main.py set_threshold --cpu 80 --memory 70
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependency Installation Errors**
   - Ensure you are using a supported Python version (3.8 or higher).
   - Activate the virtual environment before installing dependencies.
